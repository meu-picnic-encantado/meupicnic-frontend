    dream: 'The beginning of a dream',
    dreamYear: 'Our company story began in 2023',
    dreamDescription: 'On the shores of Lake Ontario, in Toronto, Canada. Inspired by the beauty of the parks and passion for creating unforgettable outdoor experiences, a couple in love with quality time decided to transform a simple picnic into a special event. That\'s how My Enchanted Picnic was born, a company dedicated to offering unique moments in nature, with comfort, elegance, and a personalized touch.',
    concept: 'Our concept is simple, yet full of meaning: bringing people together around an experience that celebrates the connection with nature and with those we love. From the beginning, we care for every detail, from choosing baskets and blankets to selecting the best ingredients and locations.',
    history: 'Our Journey',
    historyDescription1: 'Over time, our commitment to quality and innovation won the hearts of Canadians. Soon, My Enchanted Picnic became a reference in outdoor events, expanding its services to cater not only to casual gatherings but also to special celebrations such as birthdays, marriage proposals, and corporate meetings, as well as serving in the comfort of your home.',
    historyDescription2: 'In 2025, we decided to expand our borders and bring this unique concept to Brazil. We chose the city of Itajaí, in Santa Catarina, for its connection with nature, beautiful beaches, and the welcoming spirit of the community. The Brazilian branch of My Enchanted Picnic maintains the same quality standards, but now with a tropical touch, valuing local culture and flavors.',
    today: 'Today, we are proud to offer experiences that unite tradition and innovation, in Canada and Brazil, with the same goal: to create unforgettable moments, surrounded by beauty, care, and simplicity. Whether for a special day or a memorable celebration, we are here to transform your picnic into an unforgettable memory.',
